## Strings 
A string is just a string of characters. It should be surrounded by double quotes. 
```Python
my_string = "Hello"
```
## String Concatenation 
You can add strings to string to create a new string. This is called concatenation. It results in a new string. 
```Python
"Hello" + "Angela" #becomes "HelloAngela" 
```
## Escaping a String 
Because the double quote is special, it denotes a string, if you want to use it in a string, you need to escape it with a "\" ```Python
speech = "She said: \"Hi\"" print(speech) #prints: She said: "Hi"
```
